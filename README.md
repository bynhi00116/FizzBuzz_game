# FizzBuzz Game

The FizzBuzz Game is a simple programming exercise often used in interviews to assess a candidate's basic coding skills. Players take turns counting from 1 to a specified number, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz."

## Introduction

The FizzBuzz Game project provides a Python implementation of the classic FizzBuzz game. It demonstrates basic control flow, loops, and string manipulation.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fizzbuzz-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To play the FizzBuzz Game, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
